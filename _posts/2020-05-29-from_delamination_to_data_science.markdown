          There are a few reasons why I decided to learn Data Science. I currently am a Processing Engineer for a Tape Manufacturer; whose main focuses are lamination and converting. In this role I investigate common production issues within the machines and have to make improvements in order to get a greater output. After almost three years in this industry and role, it has become very repetitive and my learning path has stopped. I began looking for more ways to appease myself into my work to make it more enjoyable and have more of a learning experience that can help my future.

        Coding is a skill that not many people know and if they do, their knowledge can be limited. Knowing that coding is a field where I would always be learning something new and be able to enhance my knowledge of a certain topic intrigued me. After looking more into this field, I envisioned myself as a coder. I am a creative individual and a great problem solver. I can be faced with a single problem but come up with multiple solutions. With Data Science, you are put into a room with shareholders and are able to be in a position to introduce change and direction.   
         
				 Data science gives you the ability to give a company actionable InSite on their companyâ€™s problems and give them solutions that will benefit their company. Also, in recent events and just the job industry in general, Data Science is an industry that always needs people and provides a sort of job security. While going through this worldwide pandemic, it became clear that the future is in-fact remote and data driven. Thinking about the endless opportunities for Data Scientist excites me and is why I chose to learn Data Science.```
